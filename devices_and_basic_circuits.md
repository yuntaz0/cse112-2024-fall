# Devices and Basic Circuit

- microelectronics: modern electronics - the integrated circuit (IC) that contain billions of components in a small piece of silicon chip -> microcomputer or microprocessor
- transistor: conductivity can be controlled and manipulated
- three basic semiconductor devices: **diode**, **MOS transistor**, **bipolar transistor**
- electronic devices
  - used singly: discrete circuit
  - as components: integrated circuit

## The Lumped-element abstraction

- model systems as networks of interconnected idealized components connected by ideal conductors
- each component has a *current* flowing through it and a *voltage* that develops across it

### Terminology

- node: a set of points connected only wires
- branch: a connection between nodes (by way of a component)
- a closed path through components

## Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)

The sum of the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is 0

## Kirchhoff's Current Law

The total current flowing into any node must equal the total current flowing out of that node.

## Signal & amplifiers

- the purpose of electronic circuits is the processing of signals
- signal: time & frequency, analog & digital

## Operational amplifiers

## Semiconductors

## Diodes

## Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-effect transistor (MOSFET)

## Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)

## Transistor Amplifier
