## Charge Carrier Concentration in Doped Semiconductor

- For n-type or n-type semiconductor, we can safely conclude that the major charge carrier concentration (P type - boron - $N_A \simeq p_p$ and N type - phosphorus - $N_D \simeq n_n$) from doping charge carriers is much higher than from intrinsic charged carriers.
	- $n_n \simeq N_D \gg n_i$ is determined by doping concentration, not temperature
	- $P_p \simeq N_A \gg n_i$ is determined by doping concentration, not temperature
	- $n_i = B \cdot T ^ {\frac{3}{2}} \cdot e^{\frac{E_g}{2k \cdot T}}$ Assume $n_i$ of Si is $1.5 \times 10 ^ {10}$ at $300k$

## Resistivity in doped semiconductor

$$ R = \rho \frac{l}{A}$$
$$\rho = \frac{1}{q(p \mu_p + n \mu_n)}$$
